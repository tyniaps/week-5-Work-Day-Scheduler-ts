Third Party APIs

## Description

The Work Day Schedular was created while further exploring the topic of APIs, more specifically, Third Party APIs.

Following previous exploration into the topic of Web APIs and the ways in which JavaScript can be used to manipulate HTML and CSS elements within the browser, completing this challenge served as an introduction to jQuery and the ways in which it can be used to traverse the DOM and manipulate elements in a more efficient manner.
